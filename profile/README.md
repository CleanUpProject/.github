In Indonesia, one of the major problems in environmental health is waste. Currently, the way to get information about organic and inorganic waste management is relatively ineffective. Through this project, we developed the CleanUp application to address this issue by providing information on how to manage and recycle waste through communication and information technology. The ultimate goal is to promote environmental sustainability by encouraging proper waste disposal, recycling, and waste reduction practices among users. The cleanup app is a significant step in addressing waste management challenges through community engagement and technology.
